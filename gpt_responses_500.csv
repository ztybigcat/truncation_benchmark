7420920477821898435,to aru kagaku no railgun s episode 3,8,"No . Title Original air date 1 ( 25 ) `` Railgun '' `` Rērugan '' ( 超 電磁 砲 ( レールガン ) ) April 12 , 2013 Following an uncomfortable run in with Misaki Shokuhō , another Level 5 esper from Tokiwadai Middle School , Mikoto Misaka meets up with Kuroko Shirai , Kazari Uiharu , Ruiko Saten and Erii Haruue as they all pay a visit to Banri Edasaki in the hospital . While Erii rekindles with Banri , who is undergoing physiotherapy , Mikoto tries to come up with a way to surprise Banri with a present everyone bought for her , only to realize she had left the bag containing the present in Banri 's ward . Just then , a criminal patient that was under watch by the Anti-Skills is broken free by some of his companions and takes Erii as a hostage . Upon learning of the situation from Aiho Yomikawa and Tsuzuri Tessō , Mikoto heads to the rooftop to try and prevent the culprits escaping via helicopter . They throw Erii off the side of the building in order to break free , but she is saved thanks to Ruiko and Kuroko . Learning that her bag is onboard the fleeing helicopter , Mikoto has Kuroko teleport her to the skies where she destroys the helicopter with her railgun , with Kuroko safely apprehending the culprits . With the incident dealt with , Banri finally opens her present from everyone , which is a Sakugawa Middle School uniform for her to wear once she recovers . 2 ( 26 ) `` Critical '' `` Kuritikaru '' ( 寿命 中断 ( クリティカル ) ) April 19 , 2013 Mikoto recalls in a dream of how , when she was younger , she was approached by scientists wanting to use her DNA map to help cure Duchenne muscular dystrophy . The next morning , Kuroko tries to take Mikoto through an alleyway to get to the mall , but they encounter a few people passing by . They discover this is due to someone hiding envelopes containing cash cards within the alleyways , piquing people 's curiosity to search for them . After running into Ruiko , who is also on the hunt for the money cards , Mikoto overhears some Skill - Outs who have managed to locate the source of the envelopes and decides to follow them . Meanwhile , Ruiko grows curious as she had allegedly seen Mikoto at the mall , despite Mikoto never actually getting there , with Mii Konori explaining to Kazari about a rumor of there being clones of a Level 5 esper . The Skill - Outs eventually trace the envelopes back to a Nagatenjōki Academy student , demanding she hand over the other envelopes . Things get tense , however , when it appears the Skill - Outs are gradually getting killed off by the girl , who claims to be able to freely kill anyone she has touched . When Mikoto arrives on the scene , the girl , who had simply knocked out all the Skill - Outs using anesthetic and clever acting skills , recognizes her as the `` original '' . 3 ( 27 ) `` Project Radio Noise '' `` Redio Noizu Keikaku '' ( 超 電磁 砲 量産 計画 ( レディオ ノイズ けい かく ) ) April 26 , 2013 Mikoto is reminded of rumors about there being a clone of her and attempts to question the girl , who was distributing the envelopes in order to fill the alleyways that security cameras can not reach with human eyes . However , the girl leaves after inadvertently setting the building on fire whilst burning the evidence , simply stating Mikoto is better off not knowing as she would be unable to stop what was happening with her power . After saving the Skill - Outs , Mikoto looks up for information on the girl , whose name is revealed to be Shinobu Nunotaba , who actually worked at the same medical facility where she had given the scientists her DNA map years ago . Mikoto infiltrates the facility and comes across a room that is separate from the rest of the building 's network . Mikoto hacks into database there and is shocked to learn that the scientists tricked her into giving them her DNA map in order to create clones called `` Sisters '' , known as Project Radio Noise . However , the project was cancelled when the supercomputer , Tree Diagram , deduced that the clones would not come close to matching Mikoto 's level of power . Believing there were not any clones of her after all , Mikoto feels relieved and leaves the facility , unaware of a clone arriving later to delete the database . 4 ( 28 ) `` Sisters '' `` Shisutāzu '' ( 妹 達 ( シスターズ ) ) May 3 , 2013 Three months earlier , in an unknown facility , a pair of women scientists , later recognized as Yumi Kusakabe and Eiga Kanmi , had mentored the birth of a clone of Mikoto , labelled Misaka 9982 , installing memory functions via a capsule - like machine called Testament . Back in the present , Mikoto , who is feeling cheerful with the clone rumors being seemingly debunked , goes shopping with Kuroko and the others at the mall , helping Kazari and Erii buy a rice cooker whilst also picking out things for an upcoming school trip . The next day , as Mikoto ends up having nothing to do , some young children , including the girl whose bag she previously found , pick up on her boredom and have her play with them . Noticing one of the kids wearing a Gekota badge , Mikoto frantically goes through a whole bunch of capsule vendors in order to win one for herself . As the day comes to an end , Mikoto suddenly senses a power identical to her own and , upon chasing after its source , comes across Misaka 9982 . 5 ( 29 ) `` Project Level 6 Shift '' `` Reberu Shikkusu Shifuto Keikaku '' ( 絶対 能力 進化 計画 ( レベル 6 シフト けい かく ) ) May 10 , 2013 After unwillingly helping her rescue a kitten from a tree , Mikoto tries to question Misaka 9982 , but is unable to learn much due to being unable to decipher a codeword . She instead decides to follow her around in case she returns to her base of operations , where they end up doing some surprisingly sisterly activities . Later that evening , as Misaka 9982 points out that she is not returning to her point of origin , Mikoto takes her leave after inadvertently giving her the Gekota badge she won earlier . After receiving some help from Kazari in deciphering the codeword she was told about , Mikoto is horrified to learn of Project Level 6 Shift , in which 20,000 Sisters from Project Radio Noise are to be killed in 20,000 battles in order to evolve Academy City 's most powerful Level 5 esper , Accelerator , into a Level 6 esper . Whilst learning of this , Misaka 9982 engages in her assigned battle with the aforementioned Accelerator , finding herself helpless against his reflective abilities . Fleeing to a railway yard , she attempts a sneak attack on Accelerator using a planted mine , only for him to survive and tear off her leg . Mikoto arrives on the scene , only to look in horror as Accelerator crushes Misaka 9982 to death with a train , sending Mikoto into a furious rage . 6 ( 30 ) `` I ... Can See All of You '' `` Atashi ... Minna no Koto Miete Irukara '' ( あたし ... みんなの こと 見え て いる から ) May 17 , 2013 Mikoto unleashes her anger at Accelerator , who quickly deduces she is the original , and becomes further enraged upon seeing Misaka 9982 's torn leg and hearing Accelerator 's selfish reasons for participating in the experiment . However , even her most powerful attacks are simply reflected back at her . Just then , the fight is halted by the arrival of dozens of other Sisters , who request that Accelerator stop fighting Mikoto to avoid throwing off the experiment 's calculations . As Accelerator takes his leave , Mikoto feels no comfort in hearing the Sisters acknowledge themselves as nothing more than guinea pigs . After a restless night , Mikoto is approached by Shinobu , who explains why she chose to oppose the experiment . Having been called back from Project Radio Noise to assist in Project Level 6 Shift , Shinobu got to see the sensitive side of one of the Sisters and became unable to see them as anything other than human . Upon hearing this , Mikoto takes it upon herself to destroy the facilities involved in the experiment , keeping it a secret from Kuroko and the others . 7 ( 31 ) `` I ... I Want To Be of Help To You , Sissy '' `` Onee - sama no Chikara ni Naritai desu no '' ( お 姉 さま の 力 に なりたい です の ) May 24 , 2013 Eliminating as many facilities involved with Project Level 6 Shift through electronic warfare before she is shut out from their communication lines , Mikoto starts spending several nights attacking the other facilities directly . Kuroko , who has grown concerned about Mikoto constantly being out at night , comes across a group of girls who are looking for a `` lucky card '' , based on an urban legend spawned from the cash card incident . The next day , Kuroko encounters one of the girls , Minori , saving her from being hit by a car during her search , hearing how she wanted to find a lucky item for her friend who is moving away . After pointing out cash cards would be out of the question , since they would need to be turned into Judgment , Konori suggests that they instead search for a four - leaf clover . During their search , Kazari and Ruiko give Kuroko some assurance that Mikoto , along with themselves , appreciate her efforts . Both Kuroko and Minori find four - leaved clovers , with Kuroko keeping hers and resolving to always wait for Mikoto . Meanwhile , as Mikoto manages to dwindle down the remaining facilities to two , Kites Knockraven , a higher up in the project , prepare a counter-plan . 8 ( 32 ) `` ITEM '' `` Aitemu '' ( ITEM ( アイテム ) ) May 31 , 2013 With only two facilities remaining , Knockraven calls upon the services of the mercenary team ITEM . As Mikoto infiltrates one of these facilities , she finds herself against one of its members , Frenda Seivelun , who causes trouble for her using flammable tape and stuffed dolls containing bombs . Meanwhile , Shinobu arrives at the other remaining facility , where they are attempting to transport the data whilst the other facility is being attacked . Mikoto chases down Frenda who , after a series of failed attacks , fills the room up with nitrogen , bluffing that it is an explosive gas to prevent Mikoto from using her electricity against her . However , Mikoto , refusing to simply give up and be killed , manages to fight back against Frenda , leading to her bluff becoming exposed . As Mikoto tries to interrogate Frenda , who is unable to respond due to being shocked by her , she is suddenly attacked by ITEM 's leader and the fourth ranked Level 5 esper , Shizuri Mugino . 9 ( 33 ) `` AIM Stalker '' `` Ei Ai Emu Sutōkā '' ( 能力 追 迹 ( AIM ストーカー ) ) June 7 , 2013 Mikoto attempts to escape from Shizuri 's attacks , which proves difficult due to ITEM 's third member , Rikō Takitsubo , using her AIM Stalker ability to help Shizuri and Frenda home their attacks on her position . Meanwhile , Shinobu , who felt Mikoto should not have to carry her burden alone , sneaks into the basement of her facility where the incubated Sisters are being held , hoping to install emotions into all of the remaining Sisters via the Misaka Network in the hopes that it may move the organizers to suspend the experiments . However , she is apprehended by ITEM 's fourth member , Saiai Kinuhata , who was guarding the facility in case a second party was involved in the attacks . Shinobu manages to get the program installing , but it is suddenly blocked by an unforeseen error code . Shinobu fires a gun at Saiai to save herself , but her attack fails due to Saiai 's Offense Armor ability and she is taken into custody . Back at the other facility , a weakened Mikoto is forced to use her ability to deflect Shizuri 's Meltdowner attack , making her realize who the intruder 's identity is . Learning of this , Shizuri decides to send the injured Frenda and exhausted Rikō away so she can settle things with Mikoto herself . 10 ( 34 ) `` Meltdowner '' `` Merutodaunā '' ( 原子 崩し ( メルト ダウナー ) ) June 14 , 2013 Coming face to face with Shizuri , Mikoto uses some of the explosive dolls that Frenda inadvertently left behind to compensate for her weakened powers . Shizuri fights off these dolls by using silicon shards cards to divide her lasers , but Mikoto manages to knock her out with one of the remaining dolls . After finding and destroying the facility 's data bank , Mikoto finds herself on the run from an angered Shizuri . Fleeing to a bridge , Mikoto manages to get the best of Shizuri by using Frenda 's flammable tape to collapse the walkway underneath her and cause her to fall down . As Mikoto makes her escape , Shizuri manages to learn about Project Level 6 Shift from one of the staff and decides it would be more amusing to let Mikoto suffer . The next day , Mikoto investigates the remaining facility , only to find it completely abandoned , allegedly having gone bankrupt . Believing the experiments to finally be over , Mikoto comes across Tōma Kamijō by the vending machines . 11 ( 35 ) `` The Vending Machine '' `` Jidō Hanbaiki '' ( 自動 販売 機 ) June 21 , 2013 Mikoto runs into Tōma , who appears to have trouble remembering who she is , and vandalizes a vending machine to spit out drinks to compensate for some money it had stolen from him . Kuroko arrives on the scene and , despite not being pleased over the presence of a supposed `` boyfriend '' , feels relieved that Mikoto appears to be back to her cheerful self and takes her leave . However , Mikoto 's joy is short - lived when another Sister , Misaka 10031 , appears before her , telling her in private that the experiments are still ongoing . Horrified to learn more Sisters have died because of her , Mikoto ends up yelling at Misaka 10031 for reminding her of Misaka 9982 . Later discovering that countless other facilities have picked up the experiment , Mikoto comes to realize that her enemy is Academy City itself . Meanwhile , Accelerator recalls how he was first approached about Project Level 6 Shift . Deciding that she will need to do something drastic in order to stop the experiments , Mikoto feels relieved that Kuroko would still perform her duty as a Judgment officer should she be labelled a criminal for doing so . 12 ( 36 ) `` Tree Diagram '' `` Tsurī Daiaguramu '' ( 樹 形 図 の 設計 者 ( ツリー ダイアグラム ) ) June 28 , 2013 Mikoto resolves to hack into and destroy the Tree Diagram , the supercomputer responsible for the experiment 's calculations , in the hope she may be able to stop them . Meanwhile , Tōma encounters Misaka 10032 , who coerces him into helping her look after an abandoned kitten she had found . As Tōma goes into a bookstore to look for a book to help him with his own cat , Misaka 10032 goes off to observe Accelerator as he begins his scheduled battle with Misaka 10031 . Arriving at Tree Diagram 's control center , hoping to hack into Tree Diagram to order a halt to the experiment , Mikoto is confused to find it not only heavily low on security , but completely abandoned as well . Hacking into the system , she is horrified to learn the truth , in that Tree Diagram had been destroyed for months , with the experiments continuing regardless . 13 ( 37 ) `` Accelerator '' `` Akuserarēta '' ( 一方 通行 ( アクセラレータ ) ) July 5 , 2013 Mikoto falls in despair , realizing that with Tree Diagram destroyed , she has no way of stopping the experiments . She tries to cling onto her cause by mercilessly destroying another facility , but loses all hope when she sees a live feed of Misaka 10031 being killed by Accelerator . As Accelerator reminisces about his first experiment and his first time killing a Sister , Tōma discovers Misaka 10031 's corpse and calls the Anti-Skills to investigate it , only to find it gone when they arrive , with no evidence it ever occurred . After the Anti-Skills leave , Misaka 10032 appears before Tōma , who comes to learn the true nature of the Sisters . Upon learning this , Tōma heads for the Tokiwadai dorms to try to get some answers from Mikoto , who at the same time is contemplating her last resort . 14 ( 38 ) `` The Promise '' `` Yakusoku '' ( 約束 ) July 12 , 2013 Tōma arrives at the Tokiwadai dorms , where he is reluctantly greeted by Kuroko , who decides to let him wait for Mikoto return . When the Tokiwadai Dorm Supervisor comes by for an inspection , Kuroko is forced to hide Tōma under Mikoto 's bed due to his Imagine Breaker negating her teleportation . There , he finds the details concerning Project Level 6 Shift stuffed inside a teddy bear , learning that Misaka 10032 's experiment is next . Tōma follows a trail of windmills to a bridge where he eventually finds Mikoto and confronts her about the experiments . With all her other efforts failed , Mikoto feels convinced that letting herself be killed by Accelerator is the only way to stop the experiments , proving she does not live up to Tree Diagram 's expectations . However , Tōma , feeling her way will not save anyone , decides to stand in her way , refusing to fight back or even defend himself from Mikoto 's lightning . Mikoto 's emotions soon build up into a large shock wave that Tōma takes the full brunt of , helping her to see his resolve . After regaining consciousnesses and being greeted by a tearful Mikoto , Tōma comes up with the idea that if he as a Level 0 can defeat the Level 5 Accelerator in a fight and prove him to be actually weak , the entire basis for the experiments would fall apart . Despite Mikoto 's objection , Tōma heads off to where Misaka 10032 's experiment is being held . 15 ( 39 ) `` Tōma Kamijō '' `` Kamijō Tōma '' ( 最 弱 ( かみ じょう と うま ) ) July 19 , 2013 Despite his injuries , Tōma arrives at the site where Accelerator and Misaka 10032 are fighting and states his firm desire to rescue the Sister , saying that even if she is a clone , there is only one of her in the entire world . As their fight begins , Tōma initially struggles against Accelerator as he launches projectiles at him and sets off a dust explosion . However , Accelerator is shocked when Tōma is able to punch him with his right hand without being affected by his ability , also coming as a surprise to Mikoto , who had also rushed to the scene . Angered , Accelerator starts using his ability to manipulate the wind , creating a huge hurricane that deals a lot of damage to Tōma . Mikoto attempts to go with her original plan in order to save Tōma , only to realize it would be futile upon witnessing Accelerator using his power to create a plasma storm that would wipe out everything in the area . Realizing what can be done to stop it , Mikoto goes over to Misaka 10032 and begs for her help in protecting Tōma 's dream . Moved by these words , Misaka 10032 uses the Misaka Network to command the other Sisters in Academy City to manipulate the city 's windmills with their electricity , affecting the wind and disrupting Accelerator 's calculations , preventing him from stabilizing the plasma . As Mikoto prepares to stand off against Accelerator once more , Tōma gathers the strength to stand up . 16 ( 40 ) `` Sisterhood '' `` Shimai '' ( 姉妹 ) July 26 , 2013 Accelerator demands to know why Mikoto is protecting Misaka 10032 , to which she responds that it is simply because she is her sister . Before Accelerator can attempt to kill them , Tōma manages to regain his footing and uses the remainder of his strength to knock Accelerator out with one final punch . As he loses consciousness , Accelerator comes to the realization that the reason he wanted to become a Level 6 in the first place was so that he would not have to hurt anyone anymore . After the experiments are cancelled as a result of Accelerator 's defeat , Mikoto goes to the hospital to visit Tōma , who assures her that even though many Sisters died , it was thanks to her that they got to be born in the first place . Afterwards , Mikoto takes a walk with Misaka 10032 , where they play with another pair of sisters at the playground and think about the future that lies ahead . The next day , Mikoto borrows Ruiko 's kitchen to make some handmade cookies for Tōma as thanks for his help . Despite not getting an opportunity to give them to him , Mikoto feels pleased when he finally calls her by her proper name . 17 ( 41 ) `` Study Group '' `` Benkyō - kai '' ( 勉強 会 ) August 2 , 2013 When asked by the Dorm Supervisor to explain her absences , Mikoto bluffs that she was having study sessions with her friends . As Ruiko arranges a get together so she can hear who Mikoto was making cookies for the other day , Kuroko comes across Minori again before being dragged along by Mitsuko Kongō to a pet shop . Meanwhile , Mikoto visits Heaven Canceller to hear about the status of the Sisters , learning they are being reconfigured so they may live longer than their originally intended two year lifespan . As Mikoto and Kuroko meet up at a family restaurant , they come across Shizuri and Frenda , leading to an awkward argument between Kuroko and Frenda over their respective partners , which is inevitably followed by an explosive punishment . After having a nabe party with everyone , Kuroko is relieved to see Mikoto back to her usual self . 18 ( 42 ) `` Moving '' `` O Hikkoshi '' ( お 引越し ) August 16 , 2013 A mysterious organization oversees ITEM as they fight against a group of mechs . The next day , Mikoto and the gang visit Banri , who is due to be discharged from the hospital soon and will be moving into an apartment with Erii , who will be moving out of Kazari 's apartment as a result . As the gang discuss about the move , Kuroko and Kazari reveals Judgement will be on duty for the upcoming Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly , where Academy City 's top genius students will attend . Meanwhile , Mitsuko uses her power to stop a purse thief , only to be berated by a certain man for her actions . As the group gets together to celebrate Banri 's dischargement , Kuroko and Kazari are called off for Judgment duties when the city 's traffic signals suddenly go out . After finishing her duties , Kazari gives a box of taiyaki to Erii , serving as a memento of when she first told Erii about her ability of temperature preservation , and the two have a tearful farewell as roommates . As the group take a detour home , they come across a curious white - haired girl named Febri , who appears to know Mikoto . Meanwhile , the mysterious organization begins their next plan to show their power against espers . 19 ( 43 ) `` Academic Research Assembly '' `` Gakuentoshi Kenkyū Happyōkai '' ( 学園 都市 研究 発表 会 ) August 23 , 2013 The girls are unable to find out any more information from Febri , who appears to be a bit cautious around Mikoto and takes a liking with Ruiko . After Febri spends a night with Ruiko at Kazari 's apartment , the group , believing Febri to be a Child Error , make arrangements for her to be moved to the orphanage in Asunaro Park in a week . As the gang heads to where the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly will be held , Ruiko sets up some time for Mikoto to get along with Febri on their own . When Febri wanders off while Mikoto is not looking , the man from before spots her and sends some security bots after her . Luckily , Mikoto manages to rescue Febri , who apologizes for making her worry and comes to accept her . With Mikoto now involved , the man and his colleagues decide to include her in their experiments . 20 ( 44 ) `` Febri '' `` Feburi '' ( フェブリ ) August 30 , 2013 As Yomikawa becomes curious over how the security bots functioned without any batteries , Konori treats Mikoto and the others by taking them to the public baths , where Mikoto lets Febri keep her rare pink Gekota finger puppet from her collection . Whilst heading home , the girls are led on a detour to a warehouse , where they are attacked by a mech . As Mikoto fights against the mech , which seems resiliant to her electricity , the mech suddenly stops functioning when it comes close to attacking Febri , allowing Mitsuko to defeat it with her Aero Hand ability . After Mikoto discovers the mech to be curiously unmanned , Febri comes down with a fever and is admitted into the hospital . Meanwhile , it is shown that Shinobu is working with the group targeting Febri . Back at the hospital , Mitsuko informs the others about how she , Kinuho Wannai and Maaya Awatsuki came to learn that the man from before was attempting to `` reclaim '' Febri . The next morning as Febri seems to make a full recovery , Heaven Canceller informs Mikoto in private that Febri is in fact an artificial human . 21 ( 45 ) `` Darkness '' `` Yami '' ( 闇 ) September 6 , 2013 Heaven Canceller goes on to explain to Mikoto that Febri 's body secretes a poison , requiring her to suck special lollipops to neutralize it , leaving her angry that another dark organization is performing twisted experiments . Whilst keeping this a secret from the others , Mikoto runs into Misaka 10032 who , having visited Febri the previous night , informs her that Febri had been wanting to meet her own big sister . She also reveals Febri gained her knowledge via Testament , leading Mikoto to believe Shinobu is involved . After receiving a call from Mitsuko about the importance of trusting friends , Mikoto realizes she should not have to do this alone and decides to inform Kuroko and the others about Febri 's condition , becoming surprised and relieved to find they are more than willing to help . As Mikoto and her friends tries to find clues related to Febri , Yomikawa gives Mikoto a capsule found in the unmanned mech suit . Heaven Canceller examines the capsule which contains a strand of hair similar to Febri 's , possibly belonging to her sister . However , he also reveals to Mikoto that Febri only has enough lollipops to stay alive for another 72 hours . With Mikoto deciding to face the darkness of Academy City once more in order to save Febri , Heaven Canceller arranges for her to meet someone familiar with the underground , that being Therestina Kihara Lifeline . 22 ( 46 ) `` STUDY '' ( STUDY ) September 13 , 2013 Despite being mocked by Therestina , Mikoto refuses to leave until she gets information to save Febri . Therestina hesitantly reveals that Febri is an artificial human called a Chemicaloid , which her creators were going to showcase at the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly . Mikoto tells the others about Febri 's condition . Mitsuko , Kinoho and Maaya help Kazari identify the mysterious man as Haruki Aritomi , a longtime winner of the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly . Kazari discovers that Aritomi and other student geniuses formed the STUDY Corporation and purchased a factory , which Kazari suspects is where Febri and her lollipops were being made . Mikoto heads to the factory , spots ITEM fighting mechs sent by STUDY and overhears that the mechs are controlled via a form of psychogenesis by the capsules inside them . After ITEM leaves , Mikoto enters the factory and finds Shinobu , who had taught Febri how to say Mikoto 's name so she would be protected by her . Shinobu gives Mikoto the data to make more neutralizer lollipops , only to learn from Aritomi that the information is fake , as this confirms that he suspected Shinobu was a traitor . Aritomi orders Shinobu to inject Mikoto with a tranquilizer in exchange the real neutralizer data , but after Shinobu does it , Aritomi breaks his word and destroys the data . Febri is revealed to be a spare to his true project , Janie . 23 ( 47 ) `` Dawn of a Revolution ( Silent Party ) '' `` Kakumei Mimei '' ( 革命 未明 ( Silent Party ) ) September 20 , 2013 Aritomi reveals he started Project Chemicaloid , which created Janie and Febri due to his bitterness that espers gain fame and recognition while intellectuals like him are ignored . To finally show their power , STUDY found a way to mass - produce espers which will bring forth a revolution upon Academy City tomorrow . Later , Shinobu explains to Mikoto how she was sold to STUDY after being captured by ITEM and was forced to work on the Chemicaloids , which were born from her research , becoming determined to save them . Using her own electricity to counter the paralysis in her body , Mikoto assures Shinobu that she does not need to take everything on by herself . Kuroko and the others arrive to rescue Mikoto , whilst Shinobu chooses to stay behind in order to do her part . After learning that 20,000 mechs , controlled by Janie 's Diffusion Ghost ability , have been snuck into the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly , with the Anti-Skills prevented from interfering , the girls make preparations to save Shinobu , Febri and Janie . The next morning , Kuroko , Kazari , Ruiko , Konori , Mitsuko , Kinoho and Maaya step up to face the mechs , whilst Mikoto and Febri head off in search of Janie . 24 ( 48 ) `` Eternal Party '' ( Eternal Party ) September 27 , 2013 The entirety of Judgment joins Kuroko and the others in fighting off against STUDY 's mechs . Meanwhile , Mikoto and Febri arrive at STUDY 's hidden base at a stadium , fighting off against the mechs that Aritomi sends against them . STUDY responds by sending a signal to cut off everyone 's communications and sending more advanced mechs after each group . However , they overcome this thanks to Erii and Banri setting up a network of telepaths , with Kazari and Ruiko piloting their own mech that Mitsuko 's father sent over , whilst ITEM help to destroy the mechs sent after Mikoto . Mikoto and Febri soon arrive at the underground base , where Aritomi , having no other plans to stop her , resorts to initiating the final phase in which he reveals his secret weapon : a cluster missile from space containing Diffusion Ghost that will destroy Academy City and everyone who is in it , by causing a chain reaction with the city 's AIM fields . Aritomi attempts to kill himself , only to be stopped by Mikoto , who is determined to save everyone . With the assistance of the Sisters , Mikoto rides in Mitsuko 's mech and launches into the atmosphere , using the mech as ammunition for a massive railgun to destroy the missile . After freeing Janie from STUDY 's control and reuniting her with Febri , who is given more neutralizer lollipops , Shinobu makes plans to bring the twins to an overseas research facility to cure their condition . After saying their goodbyes to Shinobu and the twins , Mikoto and the gang discuss their upcoming vacation .

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England .

-3422350952909582054,in photosynthesis the carbon in co2 is initially fixed to what molecule,12,"In C plants , the first step in the light - independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO by the enzyme RuBisCO into 3 - phosphoglycerate . However , due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo , some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated , resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy , in what is known as photorespiration . In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway , C plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO to the RuBisCO enzyme . They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well . Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle , CO is incorporated into a 4 - carbon organic acid , which has the ability to regenerate CO in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells . Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this CO to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C pathway .","In photosynthesis, the carbon in CO2 is initially fixed to a molecule called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) through the enzyme RuBisCO. This process leads to the formation of an unstable 6-carbon compound which quickly breaks down into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).","In photosynthesis, the carbon in CO2 is initially fixed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to form a 3-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) through the process of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle.","In photosynthesis, the carbon in CO2 is initially fixed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) through the enzyme Rubisco, resulting in the formation of an unstable 6-carbon compound that splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).

-8009478076167722187,what effect do the atlas mountains have on rainfall,9,"The Sahara Desert is made even drier because of two strong rain shadow effects caused by some major mountains ranges ( whose highest points can culminate to more than 4,000 meters high ) . To the northwest , the Atlas Mountains , covering the Mediterranean coast for Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia as well as to the southeast with the Ethiopian Highlands , located in Ethiopia around the Horn of Africa . On the windward side of the Atlas Mountains , the warm , moist winds blowing from the northwest off the Atlantic Ocean which contain a lot of water vapor are forced to rise , lift up and expand over the mountain range . This causes them to cool down , which causes an excess of moisture to condense into high clouds and results in heavy precipitation over the mountain range . This is known as orographic rainfall and after this process , the air is dry because it has lost most of its moisture over the Atlas Mountains . On the leeward side , the cold , dry air starts to descend and to sink and compress , making the winds warm up . This warming causes the moisture to evaporate , making clouds disappear . This prevents rainfall formation and creates desert conditions in the Sahara . The same phenomenon occurs in the Ethiopian Highlands , but this rain shadow effect is even more pronounced because this mountain range is larger , with the tropical Monsoon of South Asia coming from the Indian Ocean and from the Arabian Sea . These produce clouds and rainfall on the windward side of the mountains , but the leeward side stays rain shadowed and extremely dry . This second extreme rain shadow effect partially explains the extreme aridity of the eastern Sahara Desert , which is the driest and the sunniest place on the planet . Similar levels of aridity and dryness are only seen in the Atacama Desert , located in Chile and Peru .","The Atlas Mountains have a significant effect on rainfall patterns in the surrounding regions. As moist air moves across the mountains, it is forced to rise, which leads to cooling and condensation. This process results in increased precipitation on the windward side (the side facing the dominant wind direction) of the mountains, while the leeward side may experience a rain shadow effect, causing a decrease in rainfall. The presence of the Atlas Mountains can thus lead to varied rainfall patterns in different areas, influencing local climates and ecosystems.",The question seems to be incomplete. Can you please provide more context or specify what you would like to know about the effects of the Atlas Mountains?,"The Atlas Mountains have various effects on the region, including influencing the climate by blocking the moisture-laden winds coming from the Atlantic Ocean and creating a rain shadow effect. This results in different climatic conditions on the north and south sides of the mountains. Additionally, the mountains play a significant role in water resource management, as they are a source of many rivers and streams that provide water for irrigation and other purposes. The mountain range also has cultural and economic significance, as it supports agricultural activities and provides opportunities for tourism and outdoor recreation.","The Atlas Mountains have various effects on the surrounding regions. They influence the climate, serving as a barrier to the humid winds from the Atlantic Ocean, leading to different weather patterns on their northern and southern slopes. The mountains also have a significant impact on water resources, as they serve as a source of several rivers and streams that provide water for irrigation and domestic use. Moreover, the Atlas Mountains play a vital role in the ecology and biodiversity of the region, providing habitats for unique flora and fauna.",0.75315374,0.6612303,0.8592452,0.8459988

6023159022192897262,when does a limit of a function not exist,9,"Formal definitions , first devised in the early 19th century , are given below . Informally , a function f assigns an output f ( x ) to every input x . We say the function has a limit L at an input p : this means f ( x ) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p . More specifically , when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p , the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand , if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart , we say the limit does not exist .","A limit of a function does not exist when the function does not approach a specific value as the independent variable approaches a certain value, or if the function approaches different values from the left and right sides of that value. This can occur when the function has a jump or a vertical asymptote at that point, or when the function oscillates without approaching a specific value.","The question is invalid as it appears to be incomplete.

Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main . Using 4 bolts to secure the main bearing caps reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts .,"The difference between a Chevy 2-bolt main and a 4-bolt main refers to the number of bolts used to secure the main bearing caps of the engine block. A 2-bolt main uses two bolts to secure each main bearing cap, while a 4-bolt main uses four bolts. Generally, a 4-bolt main engine has stronger bottom-end strength and is considered more durable for high-performance applications compared to a 2-bolt main engine.","In the context of car engines, the difference between a Chevy 2-bolt main and a 4-bolt main refers to the number of bolts securing the main bearing caps to the engine block. A 2-bolt main has 2 bolts per main bearing cap, while a 4-bolt main has 4 bolts per main bearing cap.

The additional bolts in a 4-bolt main provide extra strength and support to the crankshaft, making it more resistant to flex and movement under high stress conditions, such as high-performance or racing applications. This can result in improved durability and stability for the engine.

Therefore, the key difference lies in the strength and stability provided by the extra bolts in a 4-bolt main compared to a 2-bolt main, especially in high-performance or heavy-duty applications.","The difference between a Chevy 2-bolt main and a 4-bolt main refers to the number of bolts holding the main bearing caps in place.

For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms . In the case of tin oxides , one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms .","The concept of the atom has been around for thousands of years, but the modern understanding of the atom can be attributed to various scientists. John Dalton proposed his atomic theory in the early 19th century, and J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897.

Whoever sees the accident is to shout , `` Man overboard ! '' loudly and clearly to alert the rest of the crew . At least one person should do nothing other than stand and point at the casualty maintaining continuous visual contact . Whatever marker and flotation equipment is to hand should be thrown as near the casualty as possible by other crewmembers . This may include a horseshoe buoy or lifebuoy , a danbuoy or man overboard pole , and even a floating smoke signal . If the equipment exists , man overboard alerts are to be triggered on whatever electronic gear is available including GPS receivers and DSC radio transmitters .","The key to rescuing a person who has gone overboard is to act quickly and follow proper safety procedures. This may involve throwing flotation devices and lifebuoys, alerting nearby vessels, and initiating a man overboard drill if on a larger vessel. It is important to stay calm and focused while coordinating the rescue effort. If you have proper training and equipment, you may also need to execute a well-coordinated rescue operation using a boat, lifeboat, or other appropriate means to retrieve the person from the water.","The key to rescuing a man overboard is to act quickly and calmly. Initiating a man overboard drill or procedure is crucial, ensuring that someone keeps sight of the person in the water at all times, and deploying rescue equipment such as lifebuoys or throw ropes.

Apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways . In the intrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress , while in the extrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells . Both pathways induce cell death by activating caspases , which are proteases , or enzymes that degrade proteins . The two pathways both activate initiator caspases , which then activate executioner caspases , which then kill the cell by degrading proteins indiscriminately .","The signals for apoptosis, or programmed cell death, can come from various sources. These signals can be initiated internally by the cell itself in response to factors such as cellular damage, DNA mutations, or stress. External signals can also trigger apoptosis, such as signaling from other cells in the tissue, or through the activation of specific pathways in response to environmental or developmental cues. Overall, apoptosis is a tightly regulated process with signals originating from both within and outside the cell.","The signals for apoptosis come from various sources, including internal cellular stress, developmental cues, and external stimuli such as DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, or cell-to-cell signaling. These signals can trigger a series of molecular events within the cell, leading to programmed cell death.","Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated process that can be triggered by a variety of signals. Some of the key signaling mechanisms for apoptosis include internal factors such as DNA damage, cellular stress, and lack of survival factors, as well as external factors like signaling from nearby cells, immune cells, or the extracellular environment.

Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .

2358325362897837240,how does a star become a main sequence,8,"After condensation of mass and ignition of a star , it generates thermal energy in the dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium . During this stage of the star 's lifetime , it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass , but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors . All main - sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium , where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers . The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance . Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere . The energy is carried by either radiation or convection , with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients , higher opacity or both .","A star becomes a main sequence star when nuclear fusion begins in its core. This occurs when sufficient mass and pressure build up in the core to ignite the fusion of hydrogen into helium. As hydrogen is fused into helium, the star reaches a stable state known as the main sequence, where it will remain for the majority of its lifetime. ","The question seems to be incomplete or unclear. If you are asking about how a star becomes a main sequence star, then I can answer that in the process of stellar formation, a star begins as a cloud of gas and dust in space. Gravitational forces cause this cloud to condense and heat up, eventually forming a protostar. As the protostar continues to collapse, the core temperature and pressure increase, leading to nuclear fusion reactions that produce energy. Once the nuclear fusion reaches a stable equilibrium, the star is considered a main sequence star. If this is not the answer you were looking for, please provide additional details.","It seems like there may be a typo in your question. Did you mean to ask, ""How does a star form?"" If so, I can answer that question for you.","A star is formed through a process called stellar nucleosynthesis, which begins with the gravitational collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center becomes denser and hotter, eventually reaching a temperature and pressure that initiates nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. This fusion process releases energy, causing the star to shine. Over time, the star continues to burn hydrogen and undergo various stages of fusion, evolving through different stages depending on its mass. This process of stellar evolution ultimately determines the star's fate, whether it becomes a white dwarf, neutron star, or even a black hole.",0.6866863,0.9236336,0.67498696,0.76091826

-6483968294161399983,why is dmf used as a solvent in a wittig reaction,11,"One limitation relates to the stereochemistry of the product . With simple ylides , the product is usually mainly the Z - isomer , although a lesser amount of the E-isomer is often formed also -- this is particularly true when ketones are used . If the reaction is performed in DMF in the presence of LiI or NaI , the product is almost exclusively the Z - isomer . If the E-isomer is the desired product , the Schlosser modification may be used . With stabilised ylides the product is mainly the E-isomer , and this same isomer is also usual with the HWE reaction .","DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) is used as a solvent in a Wittig reaction because it is a polar, aprotic solvent that can effectively dissolve the reactants and provide a suitable environment for the reaction to occur. Additionally, DMF can stabilize the reagents and intermediates, promoting the formation of the desired product. Furthermore, DMF has a high boiling point, which allows for the reaction to be conducted at elevated temperatures if necessary.","DMF (dimethylformamide) is commonly used as a solvent in Wittig reactions because it can dissolve a wide range of organic compounds and can stabilize the reactive intermediates formed during the reaction. Additionally, DMF has a relatively high boiling point, which allows the reaction to be conducted at elevated temperatures if necessary.","DMF (dimethylformamide) is commonly used as a solvent in various chemical reactions and processes because of its high solvency power and ability to dissolve a wide range of compounds.

Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to `` No taxation without representation '' , that is , to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented . In addition , the well - connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers , who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business . Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies , but in Boston , embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain .","The colonists had a problem with the Tea Act of 1773 because it allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonists, bypassing the local colonial tea merchants. This undercut the local merchants and threatened their livelihoods. Additionally, the colonists felt that it was a way for the British government to exert control over them and they were angered by the lack of representation in the decision-making process regarding the tax on tea. This ultimately led to the Boston Tea Party and further escalated tensions between the colonists and the British government.","The colonists had problems with the Tea Act because it granted the British East India Company a monopoly on the tea trade, essentially giving them control over the colonial tea market. This was seen as a threat to colonial merchants and smugglers who were previously involved in the tea trade. Additionally, the colonists were frustrated because they had no representation in the British Parliament to voice their concerns about such legislation.","The colonists had a problem with the Tea Act because it granted the British East India Company a monopoly on the tea trade in the American colonies, which threatened the livelihood of colonial merchants.

As such , Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide ( Easter season ) .

These elements , including the Yule log from Yule and gift giving from Saturnalia , became syncretized into Christmas over the centuries . The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday 's inception , ranging from a sometimes raucous , drunken , carnival - like state in the Middle Ages , to a tamer family - oriented and children - centered theme introduced in a 19th - century transformation . In fact , the celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain Protestant groups , such as the Puritans , due to concerns that it was too pagan or unbiblical . Jehovah 's Witnesses also reject the celebration of Christmas .","Christmas, though a Christian holiday, began as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. The holiday has evolved over time to incorporate elements from various cultures and traditions.","Christmas, though originally a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, has also evolved over time to be celebrated by people of different faiths and cultures as a time of joy, giving, and togetherness.

It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 . It joined the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , the predecessor of the European Union , in 1973 . The state had no formal relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century , but during the 1980s and 1990s the British and Irish governments worked with the Northern Ireland parties towards a resolution to `` the Troubles '' . Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , the Irish government and Northern Ireland Executive have co-operated on a number of policy areas under the North - South Ministerial Council created by the Agreement .","Southern Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom because it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1922 after the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .","The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is responsible for communicating information between the central nervous system (CNS) and the rest of the body. It consists of nerves that extend from the brain and spinal cord to the various organs, muscles, and glands. The PNS controls voluntary movement and also regulates involuntary actions, such as heart rate and digestion. Additionally, it transmits sensory information from the body to the CNS, allowing us to perceive and respond to the environment. Overall, the PNS serves as a crucial link between the brain and the body, coordinating our physical and sensory functions.","The question is invalid.

If you meant to ask about the ""peripheral nervous system"", it is a network of nerves that connects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) to the rest of the body.

6991717984490943484,what does taking the log of something do,8,"In mathematics , the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation , just as division is the inverse of multiplication and vice versa . That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number , the base , must be raised to produce that number . In the most simple case the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor ; e.g. , since 1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 10 , the `` logarithm to base 10 '' of 1000 is 3 . More generally , exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power , always producing a positive result , so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers b and x where b is not equal to 1 . The logarithm of x to base b , denoted log ( x ) ( or log x when no confusion is possible ) , is the unique real number y such that b = x . For example , log 64 = 6 , as 64 = 2 .","Taking the logarithm of a number is a mathematical operation that gives you the exponent to which a specific base must be raised to produce that number.

This operation is widely used in various fields such as mathematics, physics, and finance.","Taking the logarithm of a number is the process of finding the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce that number. In mathematical notation, if we take the logarithm of a number x to the base b, it is denoted as log_b(x) and is defined as the exponent to which b must be raised to produce x.

7466305516926798632,what do the colors and symbols on the mexican flag represent,11,"Red , white , and green are the colors of the national liberation army in Mexico . The central emblem is the Mexican coat of arms , based on the Aztec symbol for Tenochtitlan ( now Mexico City ) , the center of the Aztec empire . It recalls the legend of an eagle sitting on a cactus while devouring a serpent that signaled to the Aztecs where to found their city , Tenochtitlan . A ribbon in the national colors is at the bottom of the coat of arms . Throughout history , the flag has changed several times , as the design of the coat of arms and the length - width ratios of the flag have been modified . However , the coat of arms has had the same features throughout : an eagle , holding a serpent in its talon , is perched on top of a prickly pear cactus ; the cactus is situated on a rock that rises above a lake . The coat of arms is derived from an Aztec legend that their gods told them to build a city where they spot an eagle on a nopal eating a serpent , which is now Mexico City .","The colors and symbols on the Mexican flag represent the following:

- Green: Represents hope and the independence movement
- White: Represents unity and the purity of the Catholic faith
- Red: Represents the blood of the national heroes who fought for independence
- The national coat of arms in the center of the flag depicts an eagle perched on a cactus with a snake in its beak, symbolizing the founding of Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City) as prophesied by the Aztecs

These symbols and colors hold great historical and cultural significance for Mexico.","The Mexican flag consists of three colors: green, white, and red. The green symbolizes hope and the independence movement, the white represents unity and purity, and the red stands for the blood of the national heroes. The national coat of arms, which is centered on the white stripe, includes an eagle holding a serpent in its beak while perched on a cactus, and this symbolizes the founding of Tenochtitlan, the ancient Aztec capital.",Flag represent?,It seems like your question was cut off.

-5084713380856397957,how does printmaking differ from other forms of art,9,"Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing , normally on paper . Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality , rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting . Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece , which is called a print . Each print produced is not considered a `` copy '' but rather is considered an `` original '' . This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process , and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique . A print may be known as an impression . Printmaking ( other than monotyping ) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions , but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to .","Printmaking differs from other forms of art in that it involves creating images or designs on a matrix, such as a woodblock, metal plate, or stone, and then transferring that image onto paper or another surface. This process allows for the production of multiple copies of the same image, known as prints. In contrast, other forms of art, such as painting or sculpting, typically result in one-of-a-kind works. Additionally, printmaking often involves specific techniques such as etching, lithography, or screen printing, each with its own unique characteristics and aesthetic possibilities.","Printmaking differs from other forms of art in that it involves creating multiple artworks from a single original image. This is typically done through techniques such as etching, engraving, or screen printing. In contrast, other forms of art, such as painting or sculpture, usually result in a single, unique piece. Each print in a printmaking edition is considered an original work of art, rather than a copy of the original image.","Printmaking differs from other forms of visual art in several ways. Firstly, printmaking involves creating multiple impressions of an image or design, typically using materials such as wood, metal, or stone to transfer the image onto paper or fabric. This allows for the creation of multiple copies of the same artwork, unlike painting or drawing, which generally result in a single original piece. Additionally, printmaking often involves specific techniques such as etching, lithography, or screen printing, which require expertise and specialized equipment. These techniques allow for unique textures, colors, and effects that may not be achievable through other artistic processes. Overall, printmaking stands out for its emphasis on reproduction, technical skill, and the potential for creating a series of related works.","The question seems to be incomplete and it is not clear what ""printmaking"" is being compared to.

7157990497406800912,seasonal variations over a full uranian year at a particular point on uranus would,14,"For a short period from March to May 2004 , large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere , giving it a Neptune - like appearance . Observations included record - breaking wind speeds of 820 km / h ( 510 mph ) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as `` Fourth of July fireworks '' . On 23 August 2006 , researchers at the Space Science Institute ( Boulder , Colorado ) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus 's surface , giving scientists more insight into Uranus 's atmospheric activity . Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known , but it appears that Uranus 's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather . Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus 's atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years , or one full Uranian year . Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year ( beginning in the 1950s ) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands , with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes . A similar periodic variation , with maxima at the solstices , has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s . Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice . The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry .","The question is invalid because Uranus does not have a defined surface like Earth, and thus it is not possible to talk about seasonal variations at a particular point on Uranus. Uranus experiences extreme tilt in its axis, which results in unique and extreme seasonal changes on its atmosphere and in its magnetosphere. Therefore, the concept of seasonal variations at a particular point is not applicable to Uranus in the same way it is on Earth.","The concept of a ""full Uranian year"" or ""seasonal variations on Uranus"" is not as straightforward as it is on Earth, due to the extreme tilt of Uranus's axis. Uranus has a tilt of approximately 98 degrees, causing it to essentially rotate on its side. This tilt results in extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing about 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.

Given this unusual axial tilt and the long duration of Uranian seasons, it becomes difficult to define a ""full year"" in the same way as we do on Earth. The concept of seasons as we understand them on Earth may not apply in the same manner on Uranus.

Therefore, it's not feasible to accurately describe seasonal variations over a Uranian year at a particular point on Uranus, as the extreme axial tilt and lengthy seasonal changes make the concept of a ""year"" or ""season"" ambiguous.","I'm sorry, but your question seems to be incomplete. It seems like you're asking about the seasonal variations over a full Uranian year at a particular point, but there is no specific point mentioned. Could you please provide more details or clarify your question?",The question is invalid as we currently don't have enough data or understanding of Uranus' atmosphere and climate to accurately describe seasonal variations over a full year at a specific point on the planet.

1393638342560837508,name and define the seven gifts of the holy spirit,10,"Wisdom is considered the first and the greatest of the gifts . It acts upon both the intellect and the will . According to St. Bernard , it both illumines the mind and instills an attraction to the divine . Adolphe Tanquerey OP explained the difference between the gift of wisdom and that of understanding , `` ... the latter is a view taken by the mind , while the former is an experience undergone by the heart ; one is light , the other love , and so they unite and complete one another . '' Wisdom is the perfection of the theological virtue of charity ; Understanding is a perceptive intuition which illuminates the mind to grasp the truths of faith . It does not involve a comprehensive understanding of the mysteries of faith , but helps a person understand that these mysteries are credible ; compatible with and related to each other ; and not unreasonable . The gift of understanding perfects the theological virtue of faith . Counsel functions as a sort of supernatural intuition , to enable a person to judge promptly and rightly , especially in difficult situations . It perfects the cardinal virtue of prudence . While prudence operates in accord with reason as enlightened by faith , the gift of counsel operates under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to illuminate the will of God . Fortitude is often identified with courage , but Aquinas takes its meaning to also encompass endurance . Joseph J. Rickaby describes it as a willingness to stand up for what is right in the sight of God , even if it means accepting rejection , verbal abuse , or physical harm . The gift of fortitude allows people the firmness of mind that is required both in doing good and in enduring evil . It is the perfection of the cardinal virtue of the same name . Knowledge : The gift of knowledge allows one , as far as is humanly possible , to see things from God 's perspective . It `` allows us to perceive the greatness of God and his love for his creatures '' through creation . Piety accords with reverence . A person with reverence recognizes his total reliance on God and comes before God with humility , trust , and love . Thomas Aquinas says that piety perfects the virtue of religion , which is an aspect of the virtue of justice , in that it accords to God that which is due him . In a series of talks on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit , Pope Francis said that piety is a recognition of `` ... our belonging to God , our deep bond with him , a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute , in communion with him , even during the most difficult and troubled moments '' . `` Piety is not mere outward religiosity ; it is that genuine religious spirit which makes us turn to the Father as his children and to grow in our love for others , seeing them as our brothers and sisters , ... '' Fear of the Lord is akin to wonder ( or awe ) : With the gift of fear of the Lord , one is made aware of the glory and majesty of God . At a June 2014 general audience Pope Francis said that it `` is no servile fear , but rather a joyful awareness of God 's grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our hearts find true peace '' . A person with wonder and awe knows that God is the perfection of all one desires . This gift is described by Aquinas as a fear of separating oneself from God . He describes the gift as a `` filial fear , '' like a child 's fear of offending his father , rather than a `` servile fear , '' that is , a fear of punishment . Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom . It is the perfection of the theological virtue of hope .","The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are traditionally understood in Christian theology as wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. These gifts are believed to be bestowed upon individuals by the Holy Spirit to help them live a life in accordance with God's will. Each gift is meant to aid in spiritual growth, moral decision-making, and the pursuit of a virtuous life.","The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.

3330795627417233017,what was the ancient chinese umbrella used for,8,"The Chinese character for umbrella is 傘 ( sǎn ) and is a pictograph resembling the modern umbrella in design . Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough - like ribs ( the branching out parts of an umbrella ) . Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent , which remains in an unaltered form to the present day . However , the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air , hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high - ranking ( though not necessarily royalty ) in China . On at least one occasion , twenty - four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting . The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun . The Chinese design was later brought to Japan via Korea and also introduced to Persia and the Western world via the Silk Road . The Chinese and Japanese traditional parasol , often used near temples , remains similar to the original ancient Chinese design .","The ancient Chinese umbrella was primarily used for protection against the sun and rain. It was also seen as a symbol of status and authority, as it was often used by officials and nobility.",The ancient Chinese used umbrellas primarily for protection against sun and rain. They were often made of oiled paper or silk stretched over a frame of mulberry bark or bamboo. The umbrella also held symbolic significance as a status symbol for the wealthy and noble.,"The ancient Chinese umbrella was called ""zhe"" or ""san"" and was made of oiled paper or silk. It was primarily used for protection against the sun rather than rain.
